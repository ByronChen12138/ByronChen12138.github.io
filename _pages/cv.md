Research Experience
======
* **_[2023-now]_ Integrating Diverse Personalities Using Large Language Model (LLM)**
  * Developed a multi-layered LLM framework enabling generative agents to emulate diverse in-game personalities for testing the games.
  * Achieved higher behavioral diversity and problem-solving strategies across three games, surpassing state-of-the-art tools in game testing coverage.
  * Authored a paper accepted by **the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025)**.
  * Currently working on data collection and LLMs fine-tuning to further improve personality alignment capabilities.

* **_[2023-2024]_ Demystifying Device-specific Compatibility Issues in Android Apps**
  * Investigated device-specific compatibility problems caused by manufacturer customizations and mis-implementations.
  * Analyzed 197 compatibility issues, systematically categorizing them, identifying affected functionalities, and characterizing effective solutions.
  * The paper was published in **the 40th International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME 2024)**.

* **_[2023]_ SURE - Exploring Generative Agents for Game Testing & Evaluation**
  * This research explored the development of generative agents with diverse personalities for game playing, testing, and evaluation.
  * A literature review on generative gaming agents was conducted, leading to the conceptualization of a model and a memory system to support these agents.
  * The project culminated in a poster presentation that garnered substantial interest from researchers and professors.

* **_[2022-2023]_ Capstone - Mining & Analyzing Hot Topics on Stack Overflow**
  * This research centred on the Natural Language Processing of IoT-related discussions on Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange.
  * Experimented with various text preprocessing techniques and modeled data using keywords and topics.
  * Utilized KeyATM and LDA for comparative analysis, aiming to assist future users of these platforms in efficiently accessing relevant information.
