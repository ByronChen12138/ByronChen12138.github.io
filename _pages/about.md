## Research and Education
I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/), supervised by Prof. [Lili Wei](https://liliweise.github.io/). My research focuses on software and game testing, game design, and Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, my doctoral work explores how human personality traits can enhance automated game testing and playability evaluation.

I completed my B.Eng. in [ECE department at McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/) (2019-2023).

## Hobbies
Iâ€™m an avid gamer...... at least I was before the Ph.D. took over my free time :P
